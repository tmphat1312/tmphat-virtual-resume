I am a senior software engineering student at **University of Science - VNUHCM**. I am passionate about software development and seeking my first job as a software engineer. I have foundational knowledge of web development through relevant courses and pet projects. **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **React**, **Next.js**, **Node.js**, **Astro**, and some other languages, tools and libraries in the web development ecosystem are my current horizon to playing around the web. As an eager learner, I am always open to new technologies and challenges. I hope to land my first job as a software engineer to gain more experience and contribute to the development of the software industry.
